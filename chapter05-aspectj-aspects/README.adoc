=== How to build

Use Gradle 4.0 to build this project. The gradle-aspectj is compatible only with this version of Gradle and
an alternative plugin to support compiling of of AspectJ files  (with aj extension" is not available at teh moment.

Since AspectJ files support with Spring will not be in future versions of this book, this module will be removed altogether.

=== Observation

IntelliJ IDEA still does not know how to handle aspects, thus my recommendation to run the examples in the command line is to
follow the next steps:

    * build the project with `gradle clean build -x test --refresh-dependencies`
    * go to `chapter05-aspectj-aspects/`
    * execute `gradle copyDependencies`
    * go to: `aspectj-aspects/build/libs`
    * execute `java -jar aspectj-aspects-5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` and you should see the following: `The Prefix foobar! The Suffix foo`
